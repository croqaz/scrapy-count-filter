# Scrapy-count-filter

Downloader Middleware that allows a Scrapy Spider to stop requests after a number of pages, or items scraped.
There is a similar functionality in the [CloseSpider extension](https://scrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/extensions.html#module-scrapy.extensions.closespider) that stops spiders after a number of pages, items, or errors, but this middleware allows defining rules per job (and per domain WIP?)
